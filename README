== Secret Santa Picker

This is an app that I seem to rebuild every year. It started as an app in plain PHP, then in Symfony, then in Rails, and now again in Rails3. Every year I build it and every year I do so in less time.

The app solves a little problem we have each year: we need to pick secret santas for about 8 people who don't live in the same city. This app allows us to fill in the names and emails and hit a button. It even then keeps track of who has/hasn't checked their pick yet.
